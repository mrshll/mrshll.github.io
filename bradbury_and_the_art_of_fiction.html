<p><strong>An Interview with Ray Bradbury</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>INTERVIEWER</strong> <br/>
Which of your recent stories are you particularly proud of?</p>

<p><strong>BRADBURY</strong> <br/>
One of my very favorite stories from any era of my career is “The Toynbee Convector.” It’s about a man who convinces the world that he has invented a time machine and that he has seen the future, and that if we don’t change things, the world will go to hell. Of course, it’s all a lie, but people believe him. In many ways, that man in that story is me, warning people about the future.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>INTERVIEWER</strong> <br/>
When you look back over your career, is there one moment that stands out as having been particularly exhilarating?</p>

<p><strong>BRADBURY</strong> <br/>
The first really great thrill was when I was twenty. I submitted a short story, “It’s Not the Heat, It’s the Hu—,” to Rob Wagner’s <em>Script</em> magazine. One day in August I got a letter from Wagner saying that it was a lovely story and that they would publish it immediately. I yelled and my mother came running down to the front yard and I showed her the letter. I was twenty years old, and we danced around the yard. They didn’t pay me anything, but they did send copies of the magazine so I could show it to all my friends and prove that I was a writer. That first sale is so important. The psychological effect of it lasts for a year! Maybe you’re not going to sell anything else for a year, but my God, you did it once.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>INTERVIEWER</strong> <br/>
Do you write for an ideal reader or a particular audience?</p>

<p><strong>BRADBURY</strong> <br/>
Every time you write for anyone, regardless of who they are, no matter how right the cause you may believe in, you lie. Steinbeck is one of the few writers out of the thirties who’s still read, because he didn’t write for causes at all. He wrote human stories that happened to represent causes indirectly. <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> and his other books are not political treatises. <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> is in a way a political treatise, but it isn’t, because all it is saying, emotionally, is: Everyone leave everyone else alone!</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>INTERVIEWER</strong> <br/>
Does literature, then, have any social obligation?</p>

<p><strong>BRADBURY</strong> <br/>
Not a direct one. It has to be through reflection, through indirection. Nikos Kazantzakis says, “Live forever.” That’s his social obligation. <em>The Saviors of God</em> celebrates life in the world. Any great work does that for you. All of Dickens says live life at the top of your energy. Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out—and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly—Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>INTERVIEWER</strong> <br/>
Why do you think that?</p>

<p><strong>BRADBURY</strong> <br/>
By giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special. That’s what we have to do for everyone, give the gift of life with our books. Say to a girl or boy at age ten, <em>Hey, life is fun! Grow tall!</em> I’ve talked to more biochemists and more astronomers and technologists in various fields, who, when they were ten years old, fell in love with John Carter and Tarzan and decided to become something romantic. Burroughs put us on the moon. All the technologists read Burroughs. I was once at Caltech with a whole bunch of scientists and they all admitted it. Two leading astronomers—one from Cornell, the other from Caltech—came out and said, <em>Yeah, that’s why we became astronomers. We wanted to see Mars more closely.</em></p>

<p>I find this in most fields. The need for romance is constant, and again, it’s pooh-poohed by intellectuals. As a result they’re going to stunt their kids. You can’t kill a dream. Social obligation has to come from living with some sense of style, high adventure, and romance. It’s like my friend Mr. Electrico.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>INTERVIEWER</strong> <br/>
That’s the character who makes a brief appearance in <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>, right? And you’ve often spoken of a real-life Mr. Electrico, though no scholar has ever been able to confirm his existence. The story has taken on a kind of mythic stature—the director of the Center for Ray Bradbury Studies calls the search for Mr. Electrico the “Holy Grail” of Bradbury scholarship.</p>

<p><strong>BRADBURY</strong> <br/>
Yes, but he was a real man. That was his real name. Circuses and carnivals were always passing through Illinois during my childhood and I was in love with their mystery. One autumn weekend, when I was twelve years old, the Dill Brothers Combined Shows came to town. One of the performers was Mr. Electrico. He sat in an electric chair. A stagehand pulled a switch and he was charged with fifty thousand volts of pure electricity. Lightning flashed in his eyes and his hair stood on end.</p>

<p>The next day, I had to go to the funeral of one of my favorite uncles. Driving back from the graveyard with my family, I looked down the hill toward the shoreline of Lake Michigan and I saw the tents and the flags of the carnival and I said to my father, <em>Stop the car.</em> He said, <em>What do you mean?</em> And I said, <em>I have to get out.</em> My father was furious with me. He expected me to stay with the family to mourn, but I got out of the car anyway and I ran down the hill toward the carnival.</p>

<p>It didn’t occur to me at the time, but I was running away from death, wasn’t I? I was running toward life. And there was Mr. Electrico sitting on the platform out in front of the carnival and I didn’t know what to say. I was scared of making a fool of myself. I had a magic trick in my pocket, one of those little ball-and-vase tricks—a little container that had a ball in it that you make disappear and reappear—and I got that out and asked, <em>Can you show me how to do this?</em> It was the right thing to do. It made a contact. He knew he was talking to a young magician. He took it, showed me how to do it, gave it back to me, then he looked at my face and said, <em>Would you like to meet those people in that tent over there? Those strange people?</em> And I said, <em>Yes sir, I would.</em> So he led me over there and he hit the tent with his cane and said, <em>Clean up your language! Clean up your language!</em> He took me in, and the first person I met was the illustrated man. Isn’t that wonderful? <em>The Illustrated Man!</em> He called himself the tattooed man, but I changed his name later for my book. I also met the strong man, the fat lady, the trapeze people, the dwarf, and the skeleton. They all became characters.</p>

<p>Mr. Electrico was a beautiful man, see, because he knew that he had a little weird kid there who was twelve years old and wanted lots of things. We walked along the shore of Lake Michigan and he treated me like a grown-up. I talked my big philosophies and he talked his little ones. Then we went out and sat on the dunes near the lake and all of a sudden he leaned over and said, <em>I’m glad you’re back in my life.</em> I said, <em>What do you mean? I don’t know you.</em> He said, <em>You were my best friend outside of Paris in 1918. You were wounded in the Ardennes and you died in my arms there. I’m glad you’re back in the world. You have a different face, a different name, but the soul shining out of your face is the same as my friend. Welcome back.</em></p>

<p>Now why did he say that? Explain that to me, why? Maybe he had a dead son, maybe he had no sons, maybe he was lonely, maybe he was an ironical jokester. Who knows? It could be that he saw the intensity with which I live. Every once in a while at a book signing I see young boys and girls who are so full of fire that it shines out of their face and you pay more attention to that. Maybe that’s what attracted him.</p>

<p>When I left the carnival that day I stood by the carousel and I watched the horses running around and around to the music of <em>Beautiful Ohio</em>, and I cried. Tears streamed down my cheeks. I knew something important had happened to me that day because of Mr. Electrico. I felt changed. He gave me importance, immortality, a mystical gift. My life was turned around completely. It makes me cold all over to think about it, but I went home and within days I started to write. I’ve never stopped.</p>

<p>Seventy-seven years ago, and I’ve remembered it perfectly. I went back and saw him that night. He sat in the chair with his sword, they pulled the switch, and his hair stood up. He reached out with his sword and touched everyone in the front row, boys and girls, men and women, with the electricity that sizzled from the sword. When he came to me, he touched me on the brow, and on the nose, and on the chin, and he said to me, in a whisper, <em>“Live forever.”</em> And I decided to.</p>
